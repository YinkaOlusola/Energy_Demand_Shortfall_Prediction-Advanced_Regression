# Spain Energy Shortfall

# Overview

The availability of electricity significantly impacts the well-being of a nation's residents. Electricity serves various crucial purposes, such as enabling communication, providing warmth, and ensuring our ability to nourish our families. Consequently, it is imperative to ensure a reliable power supply to enhance and sustain our quality of life through investments in electrical infrastructure. Nevertheless, recent evidence has shown that relying solely on non-renewable energy sources is not environmentally sustainable.

The government of Spain is determined to improve the standard of living of its citizens by ensuring a steady supply of electricity and is therefore considering an expansion of its renewable energy resource infrastructure investments as a key to achieving that. As such, they require information on the trends and patterns of the country's renewable sources and fossil fuel energy generation. For this very reason, the government of Spain has been tracking the different energy sources available within the country.


# Objectives

In this project, we were tasked with building a model for the government of Spain to predict the shortfall between energy generated by fossil fuels and energy generated with renewable sources. The daily shortfall, which was referred to as the target variable, was modelled as a function of various city-specific weather features such as `pressure`, `wind speed`, `humidity`, etc.

Using different test parameters, we assessed the different models to ascertain which has better accuracy and then deployed this model on a remote server (Amazon EC2 Instance) to make it accessible to the client.
