# Spain Energy Shortfall

# Overview

The availability of electricity significantly impacts the well-being of a nation's residents. Electricity serves various crucial purposes, such as enabling communication, providing warmth, and ensuring our ability to nourish our families. Consequently, it is imperative to ensure a reliable power supply to enhance and sustain our quality of life through investments in electrical infrastructure. Nevertheless, recent evidence has shown that relying solely on non-renewable energy sources is not environmentally sustainable.

The government of Spain is determined to improve the standard of living of its citizens by ensuring a steady supply of electricity and is therefore considering an expansion of its renewable energy resource infrastructure investments as a key to achieving that. As such, they require information on the trends and patterns of the country's renewable sources and fossil fuel energy generation. For this very reason, the government of Spain has been tracking the different energy sources available within the country.

In this project, you are tasked to model the shortfall between the energy generated by means of fossil fuels and various renewable sources - for the country of Spain. The daily shortfall, which will be referred to as the target variable, will be modelled as a function of various city-specific weather features such as `pressure`, `wind speed`, `humidity`, etc.
